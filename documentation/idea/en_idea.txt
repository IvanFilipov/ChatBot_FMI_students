Problem :

Nowadays everyone wants to be aware of whatever,
he can think about, whenever he does, only by one click.

The students from Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at Sofia University
don’t make an exception, especially the ones from the courses 
"Introduction to programming", "Object oriented programming" and 
"Data structures and algorithms". 

Looking for the easiest and fastest way to get the information they want,
the students use ‘their everyday tool’ - the social media
and especially the chats. So they write a message to their teaching assistants,
whenever the have a question.But here comes the problem …
those assistants are humans, too , so they need to take their rest,
and just can be 24/7 available to answer students’ questions.
This leads to students’ upset, because they expect a synchronic
communication - after sending their message they want the replay immediately.

The solution : 

Creating an informational chat - bot, which will serve the students’ by being there for them
all the time. It will answer the most common questions and provide the basic materials
in order to help the students.

What is more - the chat bot will help with reducing the stress from teaching assistants,
who will have their time to rest and be more productive during the practices.
